This repository is part of an assignment in Startup Campus Track AI which contains : 
1. Best prediction model to predict “Churn Status in Banking” -> 
2. Best number of clusters for “Random Points”
3. Deep Learning for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification using PyTorch with Neural Network architecture (not Convolutional Neural Network)
4. Comparison 3 different configurations while the model (code number 3) is wider/deeper
